This is the codebase for the 2025 STORM Robotics competition.

The server is the robot, and is connected to the client, which is controlled by the operator.
This client will most likely be running on their laptop, but support was added to allow the client
to run on an Android device as well. This is mostly for convenience of testing during development.
